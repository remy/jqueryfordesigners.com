		<description>&lt;p&gt;Seems that it is still needed to fix this problem when using jQuery UI, even if version of jQuery is higher than 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use accordion with jQuery 1.4.1 and UI 1.7.2 and the margin is not animated when the height is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you ?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,
I have a big problem with my jquery.
I finally made it that my slidetoggle runs in firefox.
The animation is a little bit jumpy in the end of the animation.
I read a lot of workarounds, but somehow nothing helped me really.
Perhaps anyone of you can rescue me out of this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other bigger problem is that the hidden divs are unfortunately
shown directly on start in internet explorer. I tested it in IE6&amp;7.
And the sliding effect is also very strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone of you know if I have to give additional styling for IE???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my site I am working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.haus-plan.de/&lt;em&gt;01&lt;/em&gt;Hausplan/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the red titles are slideable in the content area and the two Slide words on the right panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that Internet Explorer runs the first Slide word on the right panel correctly.
Here its div is first hidden and only shows up when we click and let it slide down.
But for the other divs they are shown in the beginning which is very sh.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help meee....&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&#039;t believe how much this has helped me stay away from going insane! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you sure though that this problem is fixed in 1.3 and higher? I am currently using 1.3.2 and I still have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I&#039;m glad you found a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,
Mikey.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just a note that the jsbin.com link in the update (http://jsbin.com/ewowo) goes to an expired page. No biggy, just a heads up.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Seems there are two different &quot;jump-bugs&quot;, one where the padding is to blame, now fixed in jQuery 1.3 (and which this video sorts out in a very good way)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other one it that whenever you have an element without fixed dimensions, the animation stops and jumps at the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(my very unprofessional guess is that it is because jquery has to calculate the animation &quot;as it goes along&quot; without fixed dimensions as a &quot;goal&quot;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatley, you can&#039;t alway set a fixed height to a element, if you want to put dynamic content in it, but in those cases, you can probably set a width, which works just as good. any dimension seems to be fine, height OR width, just as long as there is a fixed size either way!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Great post with a great video :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the same issue but only with the min-height. Again, I put it into inner  and all works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for clarifying that trick.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Vince, thanks very very much for the solution to the frustrating problem that we were having with accordion! Would never have worked it out without seeing your comment. Fixed width seems to work wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;
