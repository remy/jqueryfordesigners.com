		<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a solution - I added in the color box includes and file links before the jquery slider includes.
I think previously some of the values set in jquery.js (for the scroller) were getting reset/chnaged when I included jquery.min.js (for colorbox) later in the document.
I just switched the order of the includes around and it works fine now! Wow.
Thanks for the script - it will make a nice presentation for Red Cross Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great script! I&#039;m going to use this for a Red Cross Tsunami commemoration timeline.
I have also added the Colorbox jquery plugin for displaying pictures and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issue is that after adding colorbox while the timeline still has the click and drag functionality it has lost the functionality to scroll with the mouse wheel.
As a designer  primarily, I don&#039;t know how to fix the issue, but I have narrowed down the focus to some sort of conflict when the jquery.min.js file is linked to for the colorbox plugin. The mouse wheel scrolling returns if I remove the link to this file in the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions would be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the inital part of the project up and running here:

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there, great tutorial.
I&#039;m having a little trouble with IE (of course), where the mouse doesn&#039;t always release.
I can see a guy called Scott (from 25th Oct. &#039;08) had the same problem with Safari on a Mac.
Mine is IE8 (WindowsXP).
Many thanks in advance for any help given (from anyone).&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Would be great if it had a visible horizontal scroll as a usability enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this code.  It works and looks great.  One issue though - the overflow: hidden does not seem to take effect for me for some reason.  The #timeline div displays with a scrollbar and when I check using firebug the overflow never changes from auto to hidden.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shibi - Just use the loop or write your query and make sure to wrap the result you want to scroll in div id=timeline and ul class=tl-events and each individual result in an li tag and everything should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Very nice code, amazing effects, I am wondering whether this can be adapted to Wordpress posts to scroll by timeline. Any ideas on how to implement for Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I think you could also add  a &#039;return false&#039; at the end of the mousewheel event attachment - This would prevent the window from scrolling horizontally AND vertically if the page has content that exceeds the height of the browser window.&lt;/p&gt;
