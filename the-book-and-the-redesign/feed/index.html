		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep - the book is still in progress, though @Project2501 is right, it&#039;s definitely not finished now that we&#039;ve passed June (due to delays on both mine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the publishers side) - but I am still pressing on and I know it will be going to MEAP (early availability/first chapters, etc) soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as there&#039;s anything publicly available, I&#039;ll be publishing it here, and hopefully you have your input on what&#039;s been done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m hope you all like it and find it useful, book writing is strangely different to blog post writing: in particularly it&#039;s not interactive. Daft as it sounds, but being able to rely on links in blog posts makes a world of difference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, watch this space! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I second Tom... are you still working on the book? Having some degree of experience in that area, I was thinking that you might have been a little too optimistic regarding the book&#039;s schedule but then you also organized events and presented, worked on the jQuery API browser, etc., so being too optimistic or not, it doesn&#039;t seem like you could have been done with the book in June... unless, of course, you&#039;re actually superman(, which might explain a few things)..! At any rate, it&#039;d be good to hear whether the book is still alive. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few suggestions for the wire frames:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of comments is not that important of an element. Too many designers give it undue emphasis and this is definitely one of those cases. On the articles page - http://quicksnapper.com/remy/image/categories-0000/ - (mistakenly labeled categories btw) a huge deal is made of the number of comments for each article. A much more useful bit of information for people would be the running time of the video and perhaps an arbitrary skill-level declaration for the post in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer a popup for the videos. If a reader is on your site and following a tutorial, they&#039;re using their browser to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood grain and paper textures have been done to death. Keep it clean and keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats on the book. I&#039;ll be looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Liking the new site design - a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s up with all the black? Are you going to be peddling Black/Death Metal goods for extra cash?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to the book!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d love to see the new design keep the orange colors, it makes you unique and identifiable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good work!  More complete noob stuff please!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Your jquery tutorials are the best I&#039;ve found for simple pixel pushers like me. I&#039;m reading Jeremy Keith&#039;s &#039;Dom Scripting&#039; at the moment and I&#039;ll definitely follow it up with your book when it&#039;s available.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@William - absolutely.  The colour won&#039;t be dark - this is purely for the wireframe phase so that we&#039;re focusing on the layout and presentation before we apply colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone who posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, for those who couldn&#039;t quite see it, randomly, yes, it&#039;s an elephant!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on the book.
I also follow the site but am not one to post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to make a comment on the new design though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wire frame layouts are slick and exciting but please don&#039;t leave the color scheme dominantly black.
I always have a hard time sticking around sites that are black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, 
Thanks for the excellent resource. 
I look forward to new tutorials, screencast and reading the book when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,
William&lt;/p&gt;
