		<description>&lt;p&gt;Awesome tutorials. Im watching them all one by one to get my JQ base going. Just recently got into html and love it. Have a pretty good handle on CSS and hopefully JQ coming to a website near you!! The videos are great, even for a none-coder (yet that is) like myself. Very informative and seem to be very responsive from peoples&#039; questions. Way to go, keep making em&#039; and ill keep watchin&#039; em!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 on dana&#039;s comment… a bit tricky to navigate&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hi there - i just found your site and love it already, although i do have a suggestion to make it better ....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it would be really great / very helpful to have a clear archive of your entries / tutorials - a straight list of them by title would be fabulous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for such a great resource!
+ D .&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Love the turorials... saved a lot of time &#039;hunting&#039;. 
I started experimenting with Jquery a few months ago - I will take anything over &#039;flash&#039; but it&#039;s great which is a bonus. :)
Thanx.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I like the screencasts because I can watch what your doing and perhaps if I see something I would have a better chance of understanding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have by far the SIMPLEST blog with this kind of info. BY FAR.
I think thats why your not getting picked up on the blogsphere.
I think you need to add Digg this and similar style buttons to all of your content, and I dont know if your on other blogs cross promoting or not but I found this to be one of the most informative blogs, but also one of the most hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hi, this site is brilliant, I just feel it could do with some sort of archive / tutorial list so I can see all the things you have covered?
at the moment navigation is pretty much restricted to using related articles :(&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Really appreciate the tutorials and companion podcasts. I find myself going back and reviewing both. To me, this is the best format to understand jquery better, and the best overall resource I&#039;ve found to date. Please keep up the great work!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;great idea. I like your tutorials. making video tutorials is very interesting since it will help to well understanding expanation instead of reading it. Thank you so much for what you are doing for webdesigners. I&#039;ll put a link to your blog in my website as soon as i update it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@Cherryaa - thanks for posting your opinion.  No matter what the feedback from this survey is, I will always try to &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to provide a complete blog post that stands completely by itself without the screencast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screencast is simply for those who prefer peer-type learning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Call me a grumpy old bag but I HATE screencast tutorials! I prefer being able to hop around at will, revisit the same bit a hundred times and ignore some parts - all of which I find easier with old-fashioned writing ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multimedia tutorials are useful when I need to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; - visually - how to do something. This applies to tasks like fixing the plumbing, changing my motherboard and doing a French manicure ... not coding a website, which is all done by typing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could we have some more Old Technology tutorials, please?!&lt;/p&gt;
