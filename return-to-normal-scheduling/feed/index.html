		<description>&lt;p&gt;remy... don&#039;t know what&#039;s happened to your site. When you posted your last post, the site has become &quot;kaflooey&quot; in my firefox run on windowsXP. I&#039;ve done nothing (I know about) to Firefox so I thought it must be jW4D. To troubleshoot, I opened it in my IE6 and it still works great!!??  What gives?  I do have both css and jscript enabled. Everything else I browse to works fine, just your site has problems.  Is this myFirefox or you?? No one else in the comments has mentioned it, which thickens the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@Mattias - regarding the conferences, the Geek Meet evening was videoed and is online (though it worked before, it didn&#039;t seem to work this morning - might just be a temporary glitch).  It wasn&#039;t specifically on the subject of jQuery (though it certainly did feature heavily in the 2nd half), but still freely available if you want to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that actually, you can get any of the talks I did on my personal blog talks page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://remysharp.com/talks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://remysharp.com/talks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;+1 vote for queue/dequeue and .one screencast..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been nice to go to the conferences when you are here in Sweden, but I don&#039;t have the spare money or a company to pay for me..&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Glad to hear you&#039;ll be back in action and that you had a nice time on holiday! - I really enjoy your screencasts - it really helps in learning new concepts and techniques.   Thanks for your hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d love a simple list/archive, or access to such, of all the articles, that slider on top is OK, but its not very easy to navigate or tell which podcast is which or when it came out. plus on the front page ther is no way that i see to access the archives, you need to be in an article. but thanks for all these, they are amazing and have taught me a lot. i found them through itunes and subscribe to the podcast there. hope that continues but i find myself coming here more often than not, just to check if i&#039;ve missed anything or for some code snips. peace.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! I also like the new design but have some concerns about it in terms of user-friendliness (technical term, obviously). Looks a lot better, though, that&#039;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
