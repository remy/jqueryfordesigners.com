		<description>&lt;p&gt;Very cool. Still haven&#039;t stepped into the jq pool of magic, so hopefully your site will help.
Thanks, Rem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderfully easy to understand tutorial. The first one I&#039;ve used for jQuery where I understood it and was able to implement it to the code I had to stop a small but annoying quirk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, I very much appreciate the work you&#039;ve put into the video.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, just wanted to report a typo:  You wrote &quot;...use fadeIn(speed, opacity) so...&quot; but judging from your subsequent code and the jQuery docs I think you meant &quot;fadeTo&quot; in that sentence.  Anyway, thanks for the straightforward example of how to fix this problem!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So simple, yet easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just fixed a little gallery rollover script that I made and it&#039;s now about 95% less annoying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Remy!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;lol @mubs,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first thing I thought was exactly your comment...I&#039;ve had the same problem with a project and also found the .stop() method, but it wasn&#039;t that beautiful as it looks, the problem is, that the animation gets stopped right at the point the other starts, even when it&#039;s not finished, that leads to a &quot;staggering&quot; effect or even no effect at all, so I wanted something that ends the running animation (1 whole circle) and allows then another one...so I found the hoverFlow (Link see above) Plugin and was very pleased with it, it&#039;s some kind of extended animation function and you just replace any .animate() with .hoverFlow(e.type, { css: &quot;value&quot;, css: &quot;value&quot; }, speed, easing); and you&#039;re done...I like it a lot and it does just what it&#039;s supposed to...I indeed hat a problem that I couldn&#039;t solve with this one, and also stop didn&#039;t what I expected from it =)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the following function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
             jQuery.fn.slideFadeToggle = function(settings) {
                 settings = jQuery.extend({
                    speed:700,
                    easing : &quot;swing&quot;
                }, settings)
                
                caller = this
                if($(caller).css(&quot;display&quot;) === &quot;none&quot;){
                    $(caller).animate({
                        height: &#039;toggle&#039;
                    }, settings.speed, settings.easing);
                    $(caller).animate({
                        opacity: 1
                    }, settings.speed, settings.easing);
                }else{
                    $(caller).animate({
                        opacity: 0
                    }, settings.speed, settings.easing);
                    $(caller).animate({
                        height: &#039;toggle&#039;
                    }, settings.speed, settings.easing);
                }
            }; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the whole thing is linked to an a-tag like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
            $(&quot;#slider-button&quot;).click(function(){
                $(&quot;#formfield-container&quot;).slideFadeToggle()
            });
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the point is, I would like to have the same &quot;make one complete animation cycle&quot;-effect like on the hover things I do with .hoverFlow but in this case I couldn&#039;t make it run, maybe because I don&#039;t know where exactly to pass this function(e) from the hoverFlow Plugin...just in case somebody may know a solution to this =)....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thx in advance and thank you for the nice Screencasts!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just because of that, I&#039;ve been eschewing fadeIn and fadeOut in favour .animate({opacity:&quot;1&quot;},{queue:false, duration:200})&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fadeTo sounds better, though. Basically, I&#039;m just doing .stop().fadeTo(200,1).&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Stugoo, I was thinking the same thing.  I like the backward compatibility of your approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remy, thanks for the tutorial. I&#039;m fascinated by the autocomplete when you wrote the &quot;opacity: 0;&quot; instruction. How did you set that up and do you have any more autocomplete snippets you could share?&lt;/p&gt;
