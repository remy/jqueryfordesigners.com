		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this site and found this great tutorial for the infinite carousel, just what I was looking for. Firstly, thanks for the knowledge and run through, it helped a lot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.trashedmag.com/fanzines/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve implemented the carousel into the above site and was wondering if there&#039;s anything I can do about the second set displaying as 4 rather than 3. When the first set comes back it is also pretty jerky in it&#039;s animation. Is anyone able to offer any help please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks
Mark&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi There,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great plugin, really really nice, have implemented this on a new project I am working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wondering does this support dual carousels on one page? I have tried to use it twice but the navigation dosent seem to render the second time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers
Dave&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly this looks fantastic and I am implementing into a current project. I have successfully added the function and added auto scroll to but instead of scroll on 3 it scroll on 4 so it starts off by showing 1-3 then scrolls and shows 5-6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any reason for this. I have increased the width to:
.infiniteCarousel {
  width: 890px;
  position: relative;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.infiniteCarousel .wrapper {
  width: 790px; /* .infiniteCarousel width - (.wrapper margin-left + .wrapper margin-right) */
  overflow: auto;
  height: 105px;
  margin: 0 50px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.infiniteCarousel ul a img {&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-moz-border-radius: 5px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.infiniteCarousel .wrapper ul {
  width: 1398px; /* single item * n */
  list-style-image:none;
  list-style-position:outside;
  list-style-type:none;
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.infiniteCarousel ul li {
  display:block;
  float:left;
  padding: 10px;
  height: 109px;
  width: 243px;
}&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,  really nice effect but I am having an odd problem in my implementation. Once the carousel is done scrolling, rather than resetting it continues on to scroll into oblivion. You can see it here http://bit.ly/17Mau6 thanks in advance to anyone who has an answer for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the only things I have edited in the css are the size of the carousel and the images that are linked for the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Are there any resources out there to help with implementing this on a wordpress theme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve looked everywhere for a similar wordpress plugin or tutorial on how to achieve this in a theme template but with no luck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A point in the right direction would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Your scroller seemed great so I implemented it on my site but when doing my browser checking I found out that it doesn&#039;t work (at least out-of-the-box) with IE6. I&#039;m not a fan of IE6 like most people, but all serious web developers still have to support it as it still has more users than Chrome or the less common browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh, now I&#039;m off to find another one to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Great plugin! I have enjoyed playing around with it a bit. I&#039;ve tried using a swap image behavior, and it works fine on the images that are visible initally, but doesn&#039;t function on the others that aren&#039;t. Any thoughts on why that might be happening and how I might fix it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Awesome! Thanks for this awesome plugin.  I just finished implementing it in a Drupal site and it works flawlessly.  I did have to change two things though.  As mentioned above, I also had to add a height declaration to get it to work in IE.  I also went ahead and threw in the &quot;height: auto !important;&quot; declaration for good measure.  Also I changed the &quot;position: absolute;&quot; declaration to relative under .infiniteCarousel .wrapper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works a charm. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
