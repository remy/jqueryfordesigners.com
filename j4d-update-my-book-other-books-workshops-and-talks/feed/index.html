		<description>&lt;p&gt;I cant wait for your book to come out, iv&#039;e watched every one of your screencasts. I think they are great, easy to follow and iv&#039;e learnt all my jQuery from you. I&#039;m surprised that this is the first comment I&#039;ve ever posted on your site. I normally get all your screencasts from itunes. So I guess that&#039;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m looking forward to reading the next blog post :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps, Congratulations on becoming a dad too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Get cracking on finishing that book because personal experience tells me to expect more than only two months off once the baby comes. These little things suck the life and brains out of you the first months. It took me at least six months to get my brain functions back to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Remy, good luck in all endeavours! As a huge fan of visualjquery, are there any plans to update that to the current version (now 1.4.2)? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s just good to know that more is coming. Your contributions have been huge in my personal development process and I pimp the hell out of your work. Congrats to u and the mrs. Kids kick ass. Hopefully you can make it out to the west in the states someday. It&#039;d be great to have a jQuery conf out this way. Looking forward to more from J4D and for the book to be finished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Remy,  I&#039;m a software designer of the very distant past turned to stay-at-home mom. I  have taken up web design just over the last eight months, in need of getting back to the work place.  Your jQuery tutorials are excellent!  I enjoy the code explanations (sometimes I need a little more, so I can just pause and pop on to google), and the interactive use of the Firebug tool.  Thank you so much.   I wish you and your wife the best in your biggest blessing(and pain) in life...a baby!  I look forward to your book and will get Cody&#039;s book in the meantime.  Cheers, Leigh Ann Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, congratulations on the baby news! Lets hope you can teach him/her jQuery from a young age ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really looking forward to the book and have pretty much decided to buy it right now before I know many details, so that discount code sounds great ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Remy,
First of all, congrats on becoming a dad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pointing out Cody&#039;s jQuery Enlightments. Would also mention a very attractive price...
Count me in as a future reader/buyer of your book (&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.manning.com/sharp&quot; target=_blank&gt;jQuery for Designers&lt;/A&gt;) too.
Greg&lt;/p&gt;
