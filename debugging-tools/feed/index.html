		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, nice read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only feature i prefer from Firefox is the image options menu, displaying image information like resolution and size. I didn&#039;t find something like that in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, to open web inspector in Safari I need to hit Option - Command - i, not Command - Shift - i as you say. Just FYI.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial came to me at the perfect time. While I often use firebug for css, trying to figure out how to use it for jQuery wasn&#039;t quite as clear. This video completely cleared things up for me - love all your other tutorials as well. Keep it up!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Remy,
You did a great job! I would suggest though to cut the length of your &quot;lesson&quot; down to 30 minutes. Regarding the MSIE debugger, it has a minify button which will bring it down to the bottom of the browser in the same way as Firebug in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, i was looking for some cool jquery sliders and stuff and came across your site. I love the fact that you do screencasts cos i find learning from them so much easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randomly i was also looking for a way of debugging in IE as well as i love Firebug. This looks like a really cool website. I notice you are from Brighton as well, which is an awesome place. I used to go there back in uni days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;keep up the good work dude. I have bookmarked this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tftheatre.org/download/?caption=crossword-heaven&amp;file=4169&quot; title=&quot;Crossword Heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Crossword Heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Remy, I believe you meant to say &quot;alt/option + cmd + i&quot; opens the inspector on Safari and Chrome and not &quot;shift + cmd + i&quot;. &quot;shift + cmd + i&quot; opens Mail with a hyperlink to the page you&#039;re on, which is still pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings, Remy!  Thanks so much for these tips and techniques.  I hadn&#039;t kept up with FireQuery and its new features, and I&#039;ve recently started doing additional testing on Safari so all that information was quite welcome.  Just one question about the iTunes feed - I subscribed and the video won&#039;t sync to my iPod Touch (2nd gen).  iTunes (the app) just says it won&#039;t sync the content because it&#039;s not playable on the iPod.  Naturally my (Windows) machine has no trouble playing the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a different feed I should use, or something I&#039;m missing?  Your earlier entries in J4D would play on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to just Tweet me, I&#039;m @lightningwhelk&lt;/p&gt;
