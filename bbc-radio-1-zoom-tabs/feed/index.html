		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi There, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am doing a redesign for my own site and really LOVE these zoom tabs... The only problem is that with the latest FireFox update they don&#039;t seem to work properly anymore.... Is there any kind of workaround for this, or am i just missing something? Please let me know soon as I would really like to use this type of a feature in my redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,
Robert&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;That Lego pilot seems way too happy for someone who&#039;s about to get shot in the back. On a side note, I really love the podcasts and website. They are beyond helpful in figuring out all this jQuery stuff. Thanks so much and keep up the great work!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;i have problems with this in opera and chrome... in opera i get vertical scrolling and no tabs, and in chrome i also don&#039;t see the tabs.
I copy-pasted your source, downloaded the jquery and image directory. in Firefox runs smoothly but in opera and chrome isn&#039;t
Thx&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hi mate i like this that you have created, i was wondering if you could help me make it to auto change from one image to the next and so on, but still shows the picture when you roll over the image nav bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks and keep up the good work, your the only site online that i have found to show use how to create radio 1&#039;s image scroller. thanks&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, so random that i was looking at the BBC site the other week and thinking that this was awesome and also possible in JS. I didn&#039;t do much research into it, and it sort of sat at the back of my mind. When i started looking into it, i stumble across your podcast - by accident, and you seem to have done it. I feel kind of bad for not going at it from scratch, but your tut is awesome, and i think that its great that you are  taking real world examples and working through them from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks&lt;/p&gt;
