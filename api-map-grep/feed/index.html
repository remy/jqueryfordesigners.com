		<description>&lt;p&gt;I think you could speak a bit more fluent. I hope you&#039;ll consider this constructive criticism but I find it hard to stay focused when listening to your screencasts.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to drop you a line to say j4d is awesome, I&#039;ve learned so much in such a short period of time, just by watching your screencasts. I have to say when I first saw your TextMate font/color scheme I was blown away. I&#039;m a PC guy, but I was able to tweak Notepad++ to almost match the look and feel of your setup. I find it a lot better to work with!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your work!
--Chris&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Remy, I cannot thank you enough for creating these superb tutorials. I&#039;ve been through nearly all of them and learned so much. Great work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep on saying mynameisremysharp super-fast like you do. Makes me laugh every time.&lt;/p&gt;
