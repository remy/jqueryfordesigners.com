		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. First off, grand job. I have used the code before, and it worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am trying to use it on a wordpress website, but it&#039;s not working properly and I can seem to find the solution. I have kept all the code you have offered here, but the slider doesn&#039;t line up right, it will start in one position, and after it scrolls, the images won&#039;t line up as they originally did, meaning that after the last scroll, there is a weird &#039;jump&#039;, which reset&#039;s it back to the original state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve added the temp website link, so you can see what&#039;s going on. If you have any thoughts, I&#039;d much like to hear them asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to make this so that it&#039;s W3C compliant? When I plugged the code from the demo into http://validator.w3.org/#validate&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt;input it comes up with 4 errors. I wasn&#039;t sure how to fix the errors.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hi there,
thanks a lot for this tut. it&#039;s awesome!
i just got one problem: if i click the forward button just a sec before the automatic change, the timer keeps running and slides to the next image just when the remaining sec is over. know what i mean?
is there any way to set the &quot;timer&quot; to 0, after i clicked forward?
cheers&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi!
Thanks for your awesome website. Great tutotials and explaination.... you&#039;ve done a great job with this site. Thanks!
One question, I would like to use this carousel. Although I noticed in the screencast you mentioned a size limit. Is this the best size (in the demo), Do you not recommend to use it if I was going to make it larger... 
Thank you. Kimberly&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;What about being able to add new items dynamically through AJAX without having to refresh the page?  Like from a live RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Great tut!  Is there any way to create an effect that sort of zooms or enlarges the &#039;active&#039; image?  Something similar to the effect of the Moving Boxes script on CSS-tricks.com - http://css-tricks.com/examples/MovingBoxes/ ... that would be completely awesome if possible.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
