		<description>&lt;p&gt;Using @Morgan&#039;s code, has anyone been able to modify for pausing? Also, for those of you trying to use the stop function, it can be found in more detail at: http://drupal.org/node/329842&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to use this in a wordpress post; the rest of the wordpress site utilizes jquery 1.3.2 all over the place; if I put the scripts using 1.2.6 within the actual page posting, it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; but takes a second to load, and, when it does, the LAST slide is selected, and the slides slide backwards...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I remove the 1.2.6 load-in, it doesn&#039;t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does someone have a version that works with jquery 1.3.2?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know if it would be possible to add content (like a text dsecription) outside of the scroll container that would change based on which panel was being viewed?  Thanks for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;hello. great tutorials.
i have a question about the slider effects. i saw a slider on www.actionenvelope.com that had header links to sort items out in the slider. is this possible with jquery? i would want to try to create something with maybe color boxes sliding and have a couple sort links at the top of the slider box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so for example. - link 1 = colors  link 2 = styles
then if you click on colors the colors show up in the slider, and if you click on styles the styles show up in the header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;any direction in this would be helpful thanks. i am just learning website and find it cool. kids at school think it boring, but i like it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I have implemented this on a couple of pages on my site, but for some reason I am having trouble getting the navigation link to show the active state when that is the panel that is shown.  The class=&quot;selected&quot; is not being applied and I&#039;m not sure why not.  Any ideas?!  (here&#039;s the page:  http://www.jmbroekman.com/statement.html ).
Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;@jay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually when that happens to me its because my reference path to the script is wrong.  I know it sounds dumb, but I&#039;ve wasted TONS of time checking and re-checking code just to find out i spelled the script name wrong in the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds to me like you&#039;re not loading the javascript and its just functioning on the css id tags.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Like Lee Wilson I&#039;m having trouble getting this to automatically slide. I&#039;ve even tried to get this working on a completely blank website, using exactly the same code Remy posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of Remy&#039;s video there is no jQuery animation, it just jumps around. That&#039;s exactly what my page is like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you see any possibility to complete this very cool effect with an autoHeight method? This would be really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice article though, thanks a lot for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
