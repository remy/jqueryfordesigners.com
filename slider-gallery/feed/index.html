		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for you very interesting tutorials they have been a great help to me as a designer wanting to understand javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question I have been coming across lately and it applies above is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does apples slider animate once the load completes?
I have been asked about this type of thing a number of times and don&#039;t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you have time you could let me know where to find out or how its done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again,
Martin Leenane&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of suggestions for future features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the mousewheel plugin so you can scroll left and right with the mousewheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set hot spots on the right and left of the main content area, so that when you move your mouse towards the edge it automatically starts moving the content (like this: http://www.designcorporation.co.uk/creative_detail/creative/design/102/1/imgpan/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a bug in Internet Explorer 8 which doesn&#039;t like the display: inline on the slider li element, I was using a lot of images in the slider and it kept crashing in IE 8. Change the it to display: inline-block; and it works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve implemented this within a wordpress website, it sits in the footer. I&#039;m using the get&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;image plugin to grab thumbnails from all the posts on the site (about 170 in total) and place them in this sliding gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works fine in FireFox and Safari, but in Internet Explorer it crashes. It seems like there are too many images in the gallery, it works fine with 20 or 50 images - but the full 170, it won&#039;t do it. It takes ages to load, and then when it has finished loading, if you try and use the slider - Explorer just crashes. I&#039;m testing on IE 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Remy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wondering if your patch for UI 1.7.2 was available yet? a large amount of our other functionality hinges on 1.7.2 and Core 1.4.2 and it would be good to have a fix if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Remy, I love this little slider. It&#039;s almost perfect for what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard over and over, I&#039;m using Wordpress and was wondering how I could turn this slider into something more dynamic. It seems the basic implementation you presented gives a static version, but I think incorporating this with something like thickbox, using thumbnails and original sized photos would extend the functionality! It&#039;d be a great slider to tie in with something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NextGEN&lt;/a&gt; as well. :o)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Bit busy tonight!! (Sorry my last message I promise!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found an example from one of the comments on this article (see link below) - Wonderful and works really well, I just wondered if the javascript code could be modified to be placed within an document.ready() rather than using the older window.onload function?
I only ask as I tried to implement some other minor jQuery effects that require the document.ready() furthermore as far as I know document.ready is the better alternative - can anyone help me out - thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Got this working pretty well on this site - www.kymco.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I have a small issue with the slider, when I click on the slider you will notice the left hand side of the slider image moves across slightly and doesn&#039;t line up correctly with the image anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas why it is doing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Awesome tutorial Remy - I&#039;ve deployed this on one site and the boss was visually impressed at what jQuery could do! I only hope to learn half of what you know on jQuery and i&#039;d be happy! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again, your hard work is much appreciated!
